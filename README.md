:spades::diamonds::clubs::hearts: Milestone Project 2 for [2021 Complete Python Bootcamp from Zero to Hero in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/)

Based off the following instructions in Section 11 (#9. Milestone Project 2 Overview):

- [x] You need to create a simple text-based BlackJack game
- [x] The game needs to have one player versus an automated dealer.
- [x] The player can stand or hit.
- [x] The player must be able to pick their betting amount.
- [x] You need to keep track of the player's total money.
- [x] You need to alert the player of wins, losses, or busts, etc...
- [x] And most importantly: You must use OOP and classes in some portion of your game. You can not just use functions in your game. Use classes to help you define the Deck and the Player's hand. There are many right ways to do this, so explore it well!

- [x] ignore the following casino actions: Insurance, Split, Double Down
- [x] ties...
- [x] To play a hand of Blackjack the following steps must be followed:
  - [x] Create a deck of 52 cards
  - [x] Shuffle the deck
  - [x] Ask the Player for their bet
  - [x] Make sure that the Player's bet does not exceed their available chips
  - [x] Deal two cards to the Dealer and two cards to the Player
  - [x] Show only one of the Dealer's cards, the other remains hidden
  - [x] Show both of the Player's cards
  - [x] Ask the Player if they wish to Hit, and take another card
  - [x] If the Player's hand doesn't Bust (go over 21), ask if they'd like to Hit again.
  - [x] If a Player Stands, play the Dealer's hand. The dealer will always Hit until the Dealer's value meets or exceeds 17
        Determine the winner and adjust the Player's chips accordingly
  - [x] Ask the Player if they'd like to play again
